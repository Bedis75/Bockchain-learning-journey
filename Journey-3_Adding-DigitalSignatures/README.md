# ðŸ“š Blockchain Learning Journey â€” Stage 2: Adding Digital Signatures

---

## ðŸ“– What I Learned in This Stage

### 1. Digital Signatures & Cryptography Concepts
In this stage, I deepened my understanding of how blockchain ensures transaction authenticity and security using **digital signatures** and **public-key cryptography**.

- Explored **Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)** and why itâ€™s widely used in blockchain.
- Studied **ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm)** which Bitcoin and Ethereum use for signing transactions.
- Learned how private keys, public keys, and addresses are generated.
- Understood how messages are signed and verified to prove ownership without revealing private keys.
- Reviewed hashing functions like **SHA-256** used to secure message integrity.

### 2. Educational Resources I Followed
- [Elliptic Curve Cryptography explained â€” Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Um1cYXxkOuo)
- [How Digital Signatures work â€” Simply Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9eitAS1nsY)
- [Cryptographic Hash Functions â€” Computerphile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCvB-mhkT0w)

These videos gave me strong foundational knowledge and practical insights on how cryptographic primitives work in blockchains.

## ðŸ›  Code Improvements in My Blockchain

### 1. Account Class
- Generates an **ECDSA private/public key pair** using the `secp256k1` curve.
- Derives the **public address** by hashing the public key with SHA-256 followed by RIPEMD-160.
- Signs arbitrary messages with the private key.

### 2. Transaction Class
- Includes senderâ€™s **public key**, recipientâ€™s **address**, **amount**, **timestamp**, and **signature**.
- Calculates transaction hash to uniquely identify a transaction.

### 3. Blockchain Class Enhancements
- Implements **transaction signature verification** before accepting a transaction.
- Only adds transactions with **valid signatures** to the pool of pending transactions.
- Mines new blocks after 5 valid pending transactions.
- Maintains chain validation.
